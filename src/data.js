      "Start your timer and pour twice as much water as coffee over the grounds. The goal is even saturation, so pour slowly in a clockwise pattern. This is an essential step that should never be rushed.",
      "After about a minute, add water in stages (around 70–100g at a time) until you reach the desired final brew weight, making sure that the grounds are never exposed to air until the brew is finished. Concentrate the pour towards the center of the Chemex, working your way outwards to about a centimeter from the edge of the slurry. The water stream from the pouring kettle should be slow enough to fall straight down, not at an angle.",
